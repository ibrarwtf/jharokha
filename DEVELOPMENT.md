uv run pytest            # includes one test on the real Windows OCR engine
```

## Try it without a remote session

`tests/harness/fake_session.py` opens a local window with known text. The allowlist of client processes is `msrdc.exe`, `mstsc.exe`, `windowsapp.exe`, `windows365.exe`; override it with `JHAROKHA_PROCESSES` (comma-separated) to accept the fake window:

```
uv run python tests/harness/fake_session.py terminal     # also: chat, mail, table, lock
$env:JHAROKHA_PROCESSES = "python.exe,pythonw.exe"
uv run jharokha --window-title "Fake Remote" read
uv run jharokha --window-title "Fake Remote" bench
```

MCP end to end: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli uv run jharokha --method tools/list`, or register it in Claude Code with `claude mcp add --transport stdio jharokha -- uv run --directory <repo> jharokha`.

## Measured (2026-10-21, 4-core laptop, 125% scaling)

Real Windows 365 window, 1166x1181 client area:

| Step | ms |
|---|---|
| PrintWindow capture | 37 |
| OCR engine creation (once) | 97 |
| OCR full frame, 1.0x | 162 |
| OCR full frame, 1.5x | 358 |
| OCR full frame, 2.0x | 584 |
| OCR quarter frame, 2.0x | 108 |

- 1.5x upscale found a few more small-text lines than 1.0x, at twice the time. Default is 1.0x for the full frame and 2.0x for a region of at most a quarter of the frame.
- Two captures of an idle screen differ by ~20 pixels (text caret). The cache treats a changed area of up to 100 px² as unchanged.
- Minimized: the client rect is 0x0 and PrintWindow has nothing to draw. `IsIconic` is checked first and reported as `minimized`.
- A lock screen inside the session is detected from its text (`Press Ctrl+Alt+Del`), there is no other signal from outside.
- Fake window (`terminal` screen, 900x600): capture 59 ms, OCR 51 ms, ~52 tokens concise. Windows OCR dropped a lone `0` and `\work>` on white-on-black Consolas 12 pt; use a `region` to zoom when a value matters.

## Release

By hand: bump `pyproject.toml`, add the CHANGELOG section, commit `vX.Y.Z — summary`, tag `vX.Y.Z`, push. PyPI publishing is added at the first PyPI release.

## Secrets

CI runs gitleaks. Locally, install [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) and `pre-commit install` to run it before each commit.
