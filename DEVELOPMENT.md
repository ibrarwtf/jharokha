## Try it without a remote session

`tests/harness/fake_session.py` opens a local window showing one of the generated eval screens. The allowlist of client processes is `msrdc.exe`, `mstsc.exe`, `windowsapp.exe`, `windows365.exe`; override it with `JHAROKHA_PROCESSES` (comma-separated) to accept the fake window:

```
uv run python tests/harness/fake_session.py terminal     # also: teams, outlook, ids, lock; optional seed
$env:JHAROKHA_PROCESSES = "python.exe,pythonw.exe"
uv run jharokha --window-title "Fake Remote" read
uv run jharokha --window-title "Fake Remote" bench
```

## Evals

```
uv run python -m evals --quick            # every push in CI, a few seconds
uv run python -m evals --full             # v0.x.0 tags in CI
uv run python -m evals --quick --check    # exit 1 on a drop against evals/baseline-quick.json
uv run python -m evals --quick --update   # accept the current numbers as the baseline
uv run python -m evals --show terminal    # truth against what was read, line by line
```

`evals/screens.py` generates screens shaped like the work jharokha does: a PowerShell terminal (git log, directory tables, `sls` hits, log tails, JSON, a wrapped URL), a Teams-like chat, an Outlook-like mailbox, five lock and sign-in screens, lookalike-heavy IDs. Names, IDs and log lines come from fixed lists and a seeded generator; nothing comes from a real session, and none ever should. Seeds under 100 are for tuning, the eval scores seeds from 100. `evals/render.py` draws them with GDI and ClearType as real apps do, then through JPEG with 4:2:0 chroma, standing in for the RDP codec; `--full` adds clean GDI and PIL.

Per screen it scores CER and WER (edit distance over the truth, lines joined in reading order), bag-of-words F1 (order ignored, so F1 high with CER high means right words, wrong order), lines exact, lookalike misses, tokens of a concise read, whether `find` lands inside the drawn word, whether lock screens and only lock screens read as locked, and whether the layouts anchor picks the right app. The summary averages per app and renderer; `--check` fails when a number is worse than the baseline by more than 0.02 (rates), 10% (tokens) or 1 (lookalike misses). Timings are printed, not gated: shared runners are too noisy for them.

The numbers are deterministic: this computer (Windows 11) and CI's `windows-latest` runner gave identical summaries for both sets. If they ever drift, run the workflow by hand (`gh workflow run ci.yml`): it regenerates both baselines on the runner and uploads them as an artifact.

MCP end to end: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli uv run jharokha --method tools/list`, or register it in Claude Code with `claude mcp add --transport stdio jharokha -- uv run --directory <repo> jharokha`.

## Open

- No shared convention for marking untrusted tool output was found; ours is the `<screen_text>` wrapper.

## Release

By hand: bump `pyproject.toml`, add the CHANGELOG section, commit `vX.Y.Z — summary`, tag `vX.Y.Z`, push.

## Secrets

CI runs gitleaks. Locally, install [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) and `pre-commit install` to run it before each commit.
